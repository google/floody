<h1>Floody Security and Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The Floody tool is an HTML interface which allows users to connect
to Campaign Manager via the <a href=
"https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/guides/trafficking_overview">
Campaign Manager API</a>. Users can only connect to Campaign
Manager if they already have a User Profile set up in Campaign
Manager as well as the permissions required to manage Floodlight
activities.
<h3>Requirements</h3>
In connecting and managing Floodlight-related content in Campaign
Manager via API, the Floody tool does not do anything that is not
covered by Campaign Manager security and privacy policies. In fact,
Floody accesses very few areas that are actually available via API.
<h3>Usage of permissions</h3>
Granted Google permissions are used as follows, your security
tokens are <b>not</b> stored.
<p><i>Google Profile</i> is used only to show user photo and name
on the app, it is <b>not</b> logged or stored.</p>
<p><i>Spreadsheets</i> permission is used to ascertain your access
to the given spreadsheet and allow you to share the spreadsheet
with others.</p>
<p><i>DCM Trafficking</i> permission is used to perform action on
your behalf in Campaign Manager using the API.</p>
<p><i>Google Tag Manager</i> permission is used to perform action
on your behalf to push Floodlight Activities to GTM.</p>
